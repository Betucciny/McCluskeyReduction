# McCluskeyReduction
This program allows you to make a Boolean reduction from a truth table
Just download the entire folder and run de executable .exe, it'll allow you to make a 4 variables reduction
For more or less variables use the terminal version, which is escalable by just changing the number on the define line at the start of the code
